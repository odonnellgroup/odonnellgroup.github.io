I completed my BSc in Cell and Molecular Biology at Glasgow Caledonian University, where I developed an interest in neurobiology through my honours project looking at epigenetic regulators in motor neurons in spinal muscular atrophy. During my undergraduate degree I also undertook a Wellcome Trust biomedical vacation scholarship-funded research project at the University of Bath, where I investigated genetic risk factors in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. I was awarded my MRes in Stem Cell Neurobiology from Cardiff University in 2020 where I focused on the role of microglia and glutamate signalling in neurodegeneration.

My PhD project investigates the role of miRISC-associated proteins and miRNA in local protein control at neuronal synapses. I am using a combination of cell culture-based techniques and computational modelling of protein interactions to better understand how signalling events modulate protein expression at synapses.
